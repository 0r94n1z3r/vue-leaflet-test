# Vue Leaflet

Vue Leaflet is a JavaScript library for the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework that wraps [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) making it easy to create reactive maps.

Vue Leaflet is specifically developed for Vue3 and is written to support native SSR (no more client-only tricks)

This library is under active development, if you are curious to try please head over to the [Quickstart](/quickstart/) section

## Demo Project

While the documentation grows and the library is released we have prepared a demo project to test the functionalities: [vue-three-demo](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue3-demo-project)

## Vue2

If you are interested in using leaflet and vue in vue2 please head to Vue2Leaflet [docs](https://vue2-leaflet.netlify.app/)
